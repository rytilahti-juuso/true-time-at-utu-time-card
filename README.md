# true-time-at-utu-time-card
Contains js functions, paste them on console at kellokortti.utu.fi and run countRealWorkingTime(wantedProcentageAsInt, fullWorkDayNumber) and it should return your accurate balance of hours. Made for part time workers, because the time card takes ages to be updated to correct percentage of worker's hours. Made this for fun.
